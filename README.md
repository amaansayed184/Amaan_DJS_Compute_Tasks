# UFC Fighter Data Analysis
### 1) There was no column for age, so I added a new age column by subtracting their birth year from this year(2025)
### 2) From the visualization of data, we get to know that...people born between 1970-1980 have won more matches compared to those who were born after 2000
### 3) There were many missing values in some columns
### 4) The presence of an outlier — an exceptionally strong performer — has skewed the mean upward, making it less representative of the overall group.
### 5) The average number of wins is heavily influenced by a small group of long-tenured veterans, while newer fighters contribute to a much lower median
